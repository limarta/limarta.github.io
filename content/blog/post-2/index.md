I created a notebook illustrating an interesting algorithm for computing geodesics by using heat simulation from this paper https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/HeatMethod/paperCACM.pdf.

You can find the notebook [here](https://ian.limarta.org/HeatMethod/heat_method.html).


Notes:
- To run interactively, either use Binder or preferably download it locally and run it with Julia.
